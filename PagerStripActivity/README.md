#PagerStripActivity

##What is it?

**_PagerStripActivity_** is a custom ADT Template. It will create an Activity with PagerStrip navigational elements (with ViewPager). You can choose between *Title Strip* and *Tab Strip* style of Pager strips. 

It, being a template, is a baked and ready-to-use code which you only need to include in your Android application project. You can then customize it to your needs. 


##How to Install?

Just download the code and copy the directory to 

    `<sdk-dir>\tools\templates\activities\`

Now you are good to go.

##How to use?

After you've successfully copied the template, it will be available in the **_Create Activity_** window as *PagerStrip Activity*, while creating a new Android Application project in Eclipse. Just select the template and hit Next. Select the type of PagerStrip you need and finish the wizard. 

Tadaaa!!!

You can, of course, using *PagerStripActivity* as *Android Object*. To do so,

- Right click on your project.
- Select _New>Other..._
- From Android select *Android Object*.
- Now from the list of templates, select *PagerStrip Activity* and hit _Next_
- Fill the form and _Finish_.

*This is my first ADT Template.*
